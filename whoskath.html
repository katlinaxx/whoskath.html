 <hr>
<body> <h3><b> A. AUTONOMY </b> <br> </h3>
     Respect for an individual's right to make their own decisions. Nurses ability to independently make certain clinical and nursing practice decisions. </body>
 Nurses and advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) have a duty to themselves and their patients to fully comprehend autonomy in nursing.<p/>
 <small><em> ex: Nurses are making hundreds of decisions a day. Each time they walk into a patients room, look at vital signs and re-adjust everything from oxygen levels, administering medication to the angle at which a patient is sitting or lying down. </em> </body> </small>
     <br>
  <br>
  <br>
<h3><b>  B. NONMALEFICENCE <br> </b> </h3><body>
 Obligation to do and cause no harm to others. The obligation of a nurse not to harm the patient. This simply stated principle supports several moral rules − do not kill, do not cause pain or suffering, do not incapacitate, do not cause offense, and do not deprive others of the goods of life. </p>
 <small> <em>ex: Stopping a medication known to be harmful or refusing to give a medication to a patient if it has not been proven to be effective </small> </em>
 <br>
 <br>
 <h3> <b> C. BENEFICENCE </b> </h3> <body>
     <body>Duty to do good to others. Nurses have an obligation to act that is beneficial to their patients and support a variety of moral standards that protect and promote others' rights, prevent harm, remove difficulties that will cause harm, help people with disabilities, and rescue individuals who are in danger. </body></p>
      <small> <em>ex: If you took a patient outside to get fresh air because they've been cooped up in the hospital for weeks and weeks. You're doing something good, in their best interest.</em></small>
<br>
<br>
<h3> <b> D. JUSTICE </b></h3> <body>
    <body> Distribution of benefits and services fairly. Patients have the right to get fair and impartial treament. This indicates that a patient has the right to fairness in nursing judgements, regardless of their insurance status, financial resources, gender identity, age, and ethnicity.</body> </p>
    <small><em> ex: Patients diagnosed with cancer are entitled to a range of treatments including radio- and chemotherapy. These treatments are expensive and treat a small, but significant proportion of patients.</em></small>
    <br>
    <br>
<h3> <b> E. VERACITY </b></h3>
    <body> Obligation to tell the truth. Veracity in nursing implies nurses' honesty in their interactions with patients and colleagues. Being truthful means providing patients with facts rather than false reassurances. It is the idea under which nurses hold themselves and others accountable for providing competent, accurate patient-centered nursing care. </body> </p>
    <small><em> ex: An example of veracity in health care is informed consent. Nurses ensure that clients have a good understanding of the benefits and risks of a prescribed procedure or psychotropic medication. </em></small>
    <br>
    <br>
   <h3> <b> F.FIDELITY </b></h3>
   <body> Following through with a promise. The basic concept of fidelity is acting with integrity and trustworthiness, but nurses are also expected to work in the best interests of their patients or ciens in a professional setting. This is consistent with the belief that nurses will carry out their professional responsibilities to deliver safe, ethical,and competent care</body> </p>
   <small> <em> ex: a nurse who told their patient they were coming back in 30 minutes to check on their pain, would either come back, or delegate somebody else to come back if they got tied up. </em></small> </body>
